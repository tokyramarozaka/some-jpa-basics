Just some first exercise for one to know the difference between JPA and JPQL.

This is quite not an optimal build but it is readable, it is just used to showcase the differenc between JPA and JPQL. But nothing keeps you from using both in one single repository.

Also keep in mind : there are 3 ways to inject dependencies, either through `@Autowired` or though the constructor or using the `@Inject` annotation. Feel free to google for their main differences.
